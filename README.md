Conway’s Game of Life is a simple simulation with just a few rules: 

Cells live, die, or are born based on their neighbors. That’s it. 

And yet... the patterns that emerge are complex, beautiful, and sometimes unpredictable.

It’s a powerful reminder: complexity doesn’t require complex rules.

Much like real life — where ecosystems, economies, and even teams evolve from simple interactions — small, consistent rules can lead to extraordinary outcomes.

Sometimes, it's not about adding more rules. It's about understanding the few that matter.

This repository contains a simple C implementation of Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton.
